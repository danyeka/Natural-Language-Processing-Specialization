00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
In this video, you will
learn how to compute

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.500
the dot product between

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.095
two vectors and how
to compute the norm.

4
00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:09.360
Once you know how to
do these two things,

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.080
you'll be able to compute
the cosine similarity score.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.150
Now that you have the intuition

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.650
behind the use of cosine of

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.035
the angle between two
vector representations

9
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:20.715
as a similarity metric.

10
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.460
I'll go deeper into
an explanation and

11
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.750
then show you how to

12
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.060
calculate the cosine
similarity metric.

13
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.530
In this section, you will get

14
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.150
the cosine of the inner
angle of two vectors.

15
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.530
Then I'll show you
how the value of

16
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.170
the cosine similarity
is related to

17
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.385
the similarity of the
directions of two vectors.

18
00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:43.355
First, you have to recall some
definitions from algebra.

19
00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.290
The norm of a vector or

20
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.870
its magnitude is
written like this.

21
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.775
It's defined to be
the square root

22
00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.135
of the sum of its
elements squared.

23
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.760
The dot product between
two vectors is the sum of

24
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.635
the products between
their elements in

25
00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.290
each dimension of
the vector space.

26
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.540
Let's take another
look at two of

27
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.325
the corpora from
the last section.

28
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.065
Remember that's in this example,

29
00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.700
you have a vector space where

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.100
the representations
of the corpora is

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.450
given by the number of

32
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.765
occurrences of the
words disease and eggs.

33
00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.660
The angle between those
vector representations

34
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.550
is denoted by Beta.

35
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.440
The agriculture corpus is
represented by the vector v,

36
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.165
and the history corpus
is going to be vector

37
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.880
w. The dot products

38
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.000
between those vectors
is defined as follows.

39
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.415
From this equation,

40
00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:38.030
you see that the cosine of
the angle Beta is equal to

41
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.430
the dot-product
between the vectors

42
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.475
divided by the product
of the two norms.

43
00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.650
Replacing the actual values from

44
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.270
the vector representations

45
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.055
should give you this expression.

46
00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.760
In the numerator,

47
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.370
you'll have the product between

48
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.775
the occurrences of the
words disease and eggs,

49
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.425
and then the denominator,

50
00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.450
you have the product
between the norm of

51
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.370
the vector representations of

52
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.040
the agriculture and
history corpora,

53
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.645
ultimately, you should get a
cosine similarity of 0.87.

54
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:12.570
Feel free to pause and do
the calculations yourself.

55
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.670
But what does this
metric tells you about

56
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.250
the similarity of two
different vectors?

57
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.350
Consider when two vectors are

58
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.205
orthogonal in the vector
spaces that you know so far,

59
00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:27.230
it is only possible to have

60
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.555
positive values
for any dimension.

61
00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:34.055
The maximum angle between pair
of vectors is 90 degrees.

62
00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:37.265
In that case, the cosine
would be equal to 0,

63
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:40.505
and it would mean that
the two vectors have

64
00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:42.800
orthogonal directions or that

65
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.364
they are maximally dissimilar.

66
00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:47.060
Now let's look at the case where

67
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.280
the vectors have
the same direction.

68
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.940
In this case, the angle
between them is 0 degrees and

69
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.540
the cosine is equal to 1
Because cosine of 0 is just 1.

70
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.360
As you can see, as the cosine of

71
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.835
the angle between two
vectors approaches 1,

72
00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:04.240
the closer their directions are.

73
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.900
Now you know how to get

74
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.750
the cosine similarity
between any pair of vectors.

75
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.880
An important takeaway is that

76
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.090
this metric is proportional
to the similarity between

77
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.100
the directions of the
vectors that you are

78
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.810
comparing and that's for

79
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.405
the vector spaces
you've seen so far,

80
00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:24.500
the cosine similarity takes
values between 0 and 1.

81
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.290
To recap, you have
learned to compute

82
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.900
the cosine similarity
score between two vectors.

83
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.020
For the positive vectors
you have seen so far,

84
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.780
the score is bounded
between 0 and 1.

85
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.250
Note that if you were to take

86
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.010
any cosine similarity score
of a vector with itself,

87
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.570
you will get 1.

88
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.350
If the vectors are
perpendicular, it'll give you 0.

89
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.840
Similar vectors
have higher scores.
