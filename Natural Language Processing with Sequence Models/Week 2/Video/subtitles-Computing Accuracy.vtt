00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Now that you have
trained your NER system,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.040
you need to find a
way to evaluate it.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.080
In this video, I'll show
you how to do that.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.800
To evaluate your model,

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.240
you'll want to start by passing

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.740
the test sets through it
to get your predictions.

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.660
Then compute the arg
max or the point where

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.440
your function
reaches its maximum

9
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.340
across the prediction array.

10
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.360
You'll also need to make sure

11
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.820
your arrays are padded
using the pad token,

12
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.400
which makes your arrays
the same length.

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.380
At last, compare
the outputs against

14
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.520
your test labels to see how
accurate your model is.

15
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.820
This is how those
operations might look.

16
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.040
In Python, note that

17
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.100
the arg max function
takes an axis parameter.

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.040
To indicate this accurately,

19
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.140
you'll need to consider the
dimensions of your array.

20
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.940
The mask variable is
where you'll identify

21
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.580
any token IDs you need to
skip over during evaluation.

22
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.820
One token you might want
to skip is your pad token.

23
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.440
Think about how you might
write this quickly and simply.

24
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.020
Finally, the accuracy metric

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.240
is computed by taking the sum

26
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.480
of all your test
labels and dividing

27
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.340
it by the sum of all
your mask tokens.

28
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.570
Nice, we've now reached the
conclusion of this week.

29
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.700
Congratulations and remember
when you pad your tokens,

30
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.720
you should mask them
before computing accuracy.

31
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560
Now you're able to
process your data,

32
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.260
generate it in batches,

33
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.320
and test it for accuracy.

34
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.920
You should have everything you

35
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.700
need for the coding assignment.

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.620
Best of luck with
the assignments,

37
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.315
and remember to have fun.

38
00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:35.580
To recap, you have to
predict on the test set,

39
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.335
guess the arg max,

40
00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:39.040
mask the padded tokens,

41
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.240
and then compare with
the true labels.

42
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.190
Now you are ready to implement
this in the assignment.
