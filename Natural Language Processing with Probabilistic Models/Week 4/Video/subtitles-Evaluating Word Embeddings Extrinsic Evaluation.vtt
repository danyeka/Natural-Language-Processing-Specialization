00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.185
To test your word embedding
evaluation on external tasks,

2
00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.200
you'll probably resort
to extrinsic evaluation.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.060
For example, if you build

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.115
a system that does
speech recognition,

5
00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.860
then the only way to
know if it works is to

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.920
actually test the system
as a whole on its task.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.980
This might be more effective
than intrinsic evaluation.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.575
Let's get started. By now

9
00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.975
you have used
intrinsic evaluation.

10
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.000
Your first method for evaluating

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.370
word embeddings
based on how well

12
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.290
they capture the semantic or

13
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.765
syntactic relationships
between the words.

14
00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.340
To evaluate word embeddings
with extrinsic evaluation,

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.640
you use the word embeddings
to perform on external task,

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.100
which is typically the
real-world task that

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.830
you initially needed the
word embeddings for.

18
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.500
Then use the
performance metric of

19
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.210
this task as a proxy for

20
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.265
the quality of the
word embeddings.

21
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.295
Examples of useful word
level tasks include

22
00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:58.955
named entity recognition or
parts-of-speech tagging.

23
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.040
A named entity is
something that can

24
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.000
be referred to by a proper name.

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.510
For example, in the sentence,

26
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.790
Andrew works at deeplearning.ai.

27
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.725
The word Andrew is

28
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:13.620
a named entity and is
categorized as a person.

29
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.440
The word deeplearning.ai is

30
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.410
another named entity and

31
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.915
is categorized as
an organization.

32
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:24.200
A useful task may be to train
a model that can help you

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.280
identify and categorize named
entities in a sentence.

34
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.070
You can then evaluate
this classifier on

35
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.265
a test set with some
selected evaluation metric,

36
00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.085
such as accuracy
or the F1 score.

37
00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.050
The classifier's performance on

38
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.360
the evaluation metric represents

39
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.220
the combined performance of

40
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.475
both the embedding and
classification tasks.

41
00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.650
Extrinsic evaluation methods are

42
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.090
the ultimate tests to ensure

43
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.580
that word embeddings
are actually useful.

44
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.920
However, their main drawbacks

45
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.290
are that the evaluation
will be more

46
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.590
time-consuming than in
intrinsic evaluation

47
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.770
and that if the
performance is poor,

48
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.430
then the performance metrics
provides no information as

49
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.185
to which specific parts of the

50
00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:10.495
end-to-end process
is responsible.

51
00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.550
The word embeddings
themselves or the

52
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.710
external task used to test them.

53
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.380
So far you've evaluated
the word embeddings using

54
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.480
intrinsic and extrinsic
evaluation methods.

55
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.570
That's very nice. If you want to

56
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.550
dive deeper into this topic,

57
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.035
I've included the reference to

58
00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.555
a comprehensive and
very readable paper

59
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.910
on evaluating word embeddings.

60
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.565
You've just acquired
quite a few new skills.

61
00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.735
It's a good time to
review. That's up next.

62
00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.070
Before moving on
to the next video,

63
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.510
here are these short summary
of what you learned.

64
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.929
Extrinsic evaluation
evaluates actual usefulness

65
00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.310
of the word embedding.

66
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.560
However, it is more difficult to

67
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.840
troubleshoot and is
more time-consuming.
