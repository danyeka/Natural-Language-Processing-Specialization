00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:05.748
Hi, I'm Lysander from the open
source team at hugging face.

3
00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:06.938
At hugging face, We specialize in
democratizing machine learning.

4
00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:14.770
We want to make machine learning
as accessible as possible.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.120
And we firmly believe the only way to
do so, is to throw open source and

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.940
open science.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.636
We develop and create tools that centers
on the machine learning community.

8
00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:28.809
Tools like the transformers
library which supports dozens

9
00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.589
of transformer architectures.

10
00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.552
That can be easily used in any
natural language processing,

11
00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:36.970
computer vision or speech project.

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.222
Tools like the datasets
library to easily download and

13
00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:43.482
pre process more than
a 1000 different data sets.

14
00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:48.241
And tools like accelerate tokenizer and
others to simplify machine learning.

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:53.020
From data handling to modeling,
training and post processing.

16
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.726
These tools make up
the hugging face ecosystem,

17
00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:58.450
an ecosystem connected
by the hugging face hub.

18
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.535
A platform to collaborate on machine
learning models and datasets.

19
00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.689
Before you get started with
this lab by deployment,

20
00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.361
okay, let me introduce you to the hub
which will leverage in the next videos.

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.325
The model hub is host to more than
15,000 community contributed models,

22
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:21.990
and it offers a way to select
a model according to a task.

23
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.847
A library,

24
00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:29.040
trained on a specific data set on
a specific language with a given license.

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.626
Models can be from the hugging
face transformers library but

26
00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.240
they're not limited to it.

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.788
And the library can easily add hops
support, and some like Spacey or Allen,

28
00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:39.576
NLP among others already do.

29
00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:43.164
Furthermore, we offer tools
to push your own model and

30
00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:46.051
waits with no requirements on the library.

31
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.832
Models can be further described
by their model cards.

32
00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:52.312
And other members of the community,

33
00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:56.981
may play with the model using
the hosted inference API.

34
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.891
The dataset hub is
similar to the model hub

35
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.811
hosting thousands of data sets here too.

36
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:07.762
Mostly community contributed, these
data sets can then be selected by task,

37
00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:10.696
language, number of examples and licenses.

38
00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.092
These data sets off for

39
00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:16.588
a comprehensive data set card explaining
how the data set was designed.

40
00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:21.219
Where the data came from and
considerations when using the data,

41
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.740
both in terms of social impact and biases.

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.941
Additionally, it offers a quick
link to models fine tuned or

43
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:30.440
trained on these data sets.

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.271
We're very excited to partner with
deploying data on discourse focused on

45
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:35.136
transformers.

46
00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:36.209
In the upcoming labs,

47
00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.547
you'll get a chance to practice using
some of the hugging face tools.

48
00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.594
Like transformers, data sets and

49
00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.640
the hugging face hub to find
you in a pre trained model.

50
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.656
Have fun and looking forward to
seeing your fine tune models.
