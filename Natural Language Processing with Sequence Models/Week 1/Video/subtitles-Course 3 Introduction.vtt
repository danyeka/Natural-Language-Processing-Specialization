00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Welcome to the third course
of this specialization.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.920
This course is called Natural

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.660
Language Processing
with Sequence Models.

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.420
In this course, here are some
things you get to build.

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.200
First, you take
sentiment analysis

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.260
to the next level with
deep neuron networks.

7
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.120
You also build a
language generator

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.060
using RNNs or recurrent
neuron networks.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.640
You apply LSTM units.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.900
LSTM stands for Long
Short-Term Memory.

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.040
You apply LSTM units to

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.055
the problem of named
entity recognition.

13
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.540
Finally, you use

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.660
Siamese networks to identify
duplicate questions.

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.340
Like say if there's an
online discussion forum

16
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
and different people
are asking questions,

17
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.900
can you figure out if
two different people

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.580
ask essentially
the same question,

19
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.860
but with different wording?

20
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.080
With the skills you
develop in this course,

21
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.400
you'll be able to build
powerful NLP systems to

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.125
solve problems across a
wide range of industries.

23
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.975
It is my pleasure
to welcome Lucasz

24
00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:07.340
and Younes as your
instructors for this course,

25
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.160
and they are thrilled to dive
into these topics with you.

26
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.760
Younes, perhaps you could
say a bit more about

27
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.130
the applications that learners
will build in this course?

28
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.360
Sure thing, thanks Andrew.

29
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.140
Well, I'd like to
start by saying

30
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.980
that in the first two courses
of this specialization,

31
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.060
you built a powerful foundation

32
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460
that will provide you with

33
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.940
both the context and

34
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.740
the fundamental skills you
need to tackle this course.

35
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.780
For example, you've already

36
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.055
done sentiment
analysis in Course 1,

37
00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.670
with a simple naive
bayes classifier.

38
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.480
But now you, will
leverage the power of

39
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.120
deep neural networks to build

40
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.180
a much more robust sentiment
analysis classifier.

41
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.580
You've also seen how to do

42
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.260
things like predict
the next word in

43
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.700
a sequence using

44
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050
relatively simple n-gram
language models in Course 2.

45
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.340
In this course, you'll create

46
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.700
an advanced model using

47
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.520
recurrent neural networks
to generate texts.

48
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.400
You can think of this course
as taking the step from

49
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.600
foundational skills
into building

50
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.700
real world NLP applications.

51
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.210
Very cool, Younes.

52
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.750
I think that's a great
way to think about it.

53
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.600
Lucasz, maybe you
could say a bit

54
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.930
more about the applications
learners will get to build?

55
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.090
Sure. Thank you, Andrew.

56
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.380
Well, as you saw in
the first course,

57
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.680
the problem of sentiment
analysis is a really tricky one.

58
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.260
But in many applications,

59
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.520
you want to determine the
sentiment of a sentence,

60
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.320
so it's a really good
problem to work on as well.

61
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.660
With language modeling,

62
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.940
the problems you can solve
are almost infinite.

63
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.580
From translation
to autocomplete,

64
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580
to generating text from scratch.

65
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.240
In Week 2 of this course,

66
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.540
you'll work on named
Entity Recognition,

67
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780
which is the problem of
separating named entity

68
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.300
in sentences like
people and places.

69
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.765
This is a building block of
many important NLP systems.

70
00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.185
Finally, in Week
3 of this course,

71
00:02:57.185 --> 00:03:00.125
we will tackle the problem
of identifying duplicates.

72
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.540
The question of whether
two pieces of texts or

73
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.980
duplicates of each other might

74
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.960
not sound very
interesting at first,

75
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.720
but as you'll see, it's actually

76
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.340
core building block
of things like

77
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.215
online forms and search engines,

78
00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:13.120
and we'll show you
how to solve it.

79
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000
We're really excited to show you

80
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280
these applications and bring

81
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.875
your skills to the next level.

82
00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:20.185
Thank you, Lucasz and
thank you, Younes.

83
00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:23.050
This is going to be
an exciting course.

84
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.595
Let's get started.

85
00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:25.420
Good luck.

86
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.020
Have fun.
