00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
I will show you one of

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.360
the most commonly
used Benchmarks

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.205
in natural language processing.

4
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.550
Specifically, you'll learn
about the GLUE Benchmark.

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.005
This is used to train,

6
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.780
evaluate, analyze NLP tasks.

7
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.550
Let's take a look at this
in some more detail.

8
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.785
The glue benchmark stands for

9
00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.835
General Language
Understanding Evaluation.

10
00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.290
It is basically a collection
that is used to train,

11
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.535
evaluate, analyze natural
language understanding systems.

12
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.940
It has a lot of datasets
and each dataset has

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.055
several genres and there are

14
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.485
different sizes and
different difficulties.

15
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.390
Some of them are, for example,

16
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.505
used for co-reference
resolution.

17
00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:44.125
Others are just used for
simple sentiment analysis,

18
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.760
others are used for question
answering, and so forth.

19
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.015
It is used with a leaderboard,

20
00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:54.050
so people can use
the datasets and see

21
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.650
how well their models
perform compared to others.

22
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.260
Tasks evaluated on could be,

23
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.040
for example, sentence
grammatical or not.

24
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.850
For example, if a sentence
makes sense or it does not,

25
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.790
is going to be
used on sentiment,

26
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.070
it could be used to
paraphrase some texts,

27
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.830
it could be used on similarity,
on question duplicates.

28
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.015
Whether a question is
answerable or not,

29
00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:24.080
whether it's a contradiction,
whether it's entailment.

30
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.245
Also, for the Winograd schema,

31
00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.200
which is basically
trying to identify

32
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.150
whether a pronoun refers

33
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.835
to a certain noun
or to another noun.

34
00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:36.950
It's used to drive research.

35
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.080
As I said, that
researchers usually use

36
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.755
the GLUE as a benchmark.

37
00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:43.940
It is also a model agnostic,

38
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.460
so it doesn't matter
which model you use.

39
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.830
Just evaluate on GLUE and

40
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.325
see how well your
model performs.

41
00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:53.240
Finally, it allows you to make

42
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.160
use of transfer learning
because you have

43
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.125
access to several datasets

44
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.585
and you can learn
certain things from

45
00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.655
different datasets
that will help you

46
00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.440
evaluate on a completely
new datasets within GLUE.

47
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.130
You now know not only how to

48
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.065
implement states
of the art models,

49
00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:11.525
but you also know how
to evaluate them.

50
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:12.994
In the next video,

51
00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:15.290
I'll be talking about
question answering

52
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.000
and I'll show you
how you can use

53
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.410
these models to build

54
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.680
a sophisticated QA system.
I'll see you there.
