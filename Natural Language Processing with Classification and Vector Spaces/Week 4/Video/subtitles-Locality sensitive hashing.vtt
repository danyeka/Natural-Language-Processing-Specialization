00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:05.606
One key method that you will use to
reduce the computational cost of finding

2
00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:09.810
Neighbors in high dimensional spaces
is locality sensitive hashing.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.306
In this video, I will teach you what
hashes are and where they are used.

4
00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.445
To start thinking about
locality sensitive hashing,

5
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.031
let's first assume that you're using
word vectors with just two dimensions.

6
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.529
Other pits each vector as
a circle instead of arrows.

7
00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.597
So let's say you want to find a way to
know that these blue dots are somehow

8
00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:34.280
close to each other, and that these grey
dots are also related to each other.

9
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.870
First divide the space using these
dashed lines, which I'll call planes.

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.291
I'll explain why I call
them planes in a bit.

11
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:48.875
Notice how the blue plain slices up the
space into vectors that are above it or

12
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:49.669
below it.

13
00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:53.002
The blue vectors all happen to be
on the same side of the blue plane.

14
00:00:53.002 --> 00:01:00.288
Similarly, the gray vectors happen
to be above the grey plane.

15
00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:04.394
It looks like the planes can help us
bucket the vectors into subsets based on

16
00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:07.081
their location,
this is exactly what you want.

17
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:11.680
A hashing function that is sensitive
to the location of the items that it's

18
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.286
assigning into buckets.

19
00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.972
You're working your way towards
locality sensitive hashing.

20
00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:21.038
Now, let's see why I'm calling
these dash lines planes.

21
00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:25.689
A plane would be this magenta line into
two dimensional space and it actually

22
00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.207
represents all the possible vectors
that would be sitting on that plane.

23
00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:35.927
In other words, they would be parallel
to the plane such as this blue vector or

24
00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:37.520
this orange vector.

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.721
You can define a plane with a single
vector, this magenta vector is

26
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:46.614
perpendicular to the plane and it's
called the normal vector to that plain.

27
00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:51.900
The normal vector is perpendicular to
any vectors that lie on the plane.

28
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.686
It might help to think about
this in three dimensions,

29
00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:58.417
find a sheet of paper and find a pencil.

30
00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:02.483
Place the paper on the table and
draw some vectors on it,

31
00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:06.040
then hold the pencil
vertically over the paper.

32
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.959
Any vectors on the paper
are perpendicular to the pencil.

33
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.766
Let's go back to two dimensions, you are
able to see visually when the vector is on

34
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.796
one side of the plane or the other.

35
00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:19.471
But how do you do this mathematically?

36
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:23.864
Here are three sample vectors in blue,
orange and

37
00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:28.476
green, the normal vector
to the plane is labeled P.

38
00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:30.582
Let's focus on vector one,

39
00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:35.603
what if you take the dot product of
P with vector one, you get three.

40
00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:37.675
I'll explain in a bit
why you're doing this.

41
00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:40.241
Now, Let's look at Vector two,

42
00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:44.924
if you take the dot products of
P with vector two you get zero.

43
00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:47.696
Finally, Let's look at the extra three,

44
00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:52.561
if you take the dot product of P with
vector three, you get negative three.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.797
So the dots products are three,
zero, and negative three.

46
00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:01.522
Do you notice something
about the signs and

47
00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:05.549
how they're related to their
position relative to the red plane?

48
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.746
When the dot product is positive,
the vector is on one side of the plane.

49
00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:14.979
If the dot product is negative, the vector
is on the opposite side of the plane.

50
00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.561
If the dot product is zero,
the vector is on the plane, so

51
00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.663
what's the dot products doing.

52
00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:22.693
To visualize the dot product,

53
00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:27.387
imagine one of the vectors such as P
as if it's the surface of the earth.

54
00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:32.364
Gravity pulls all objects straight
down towards the surface of the earth,

55
00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:36.326
next pretend you're standing
at the end of the vector V1.

56
00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:42.223
You tie a string to a rock and
let gravity pull the rock to the surface

57
00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:47.083
of vector P,
the string is perpendicular to vector P.

58
00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:52.012
Now, if you draw a vector that's in
the same direction of P, what ends up at

59
00:03:52.012 --> 00:03:57.201
the rock, you have what's called
the projection of vector V1 onto vector P.

60
00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:04.332
The magnitude or length of that vector is
equal to the dot product of V one and P.

61
00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:10.298
Furthermore, if you had this other green
vector and projected it onto vector p,

62
00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:16.541
the projected vector would be pointing in
the parallel but opposite direction of P.

63
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.590
The dot product would
be a negative number.

64
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.414
This means that the sign of the dot
product indicates the direction of

65
00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:27.505
the projection with respect
to the purple normal vector.

66
00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:32.246
So whether the dot product is positive or
negative can tell you

67
00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:37.550
whether the vector V1 or V2 are on
one side of the plane or the other.

68
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.596
Let's use code to check which
side of the plane a vector is on.

69
00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:46.959
The function side of plane takes in
the normal vector P and a vector V.

70
00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.050
Use np dot to take the dot product,

71
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.813
use np dot sign to get a plus one,
if the dot product is positive.

72
00:04:55.813 --> 00:04:58.732
-1 if the product is negative or

73
00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:04.061
zero if the dot product is zero,
I'm using np dot as scalar.

74
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:09.266
Notice the pronunciation of that function,
if a vector can be represented

75
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:14.319
as a single scalar, dysfunction
retrieves that scalar and that's it.

76
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.327
Please try it out for yourself,
that was a lot of visualizations and

77
00:05:18.327 --> 00:05:19.885
the lots of projections.

78
00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:24.821
The main takeaway is that the sign of the
projection of two vectors tells you which

79
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:26.861
parts of the line the point lies.

80
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:29.209
For example, above it or below it.

81
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:34.017
In the next video, you will learn how to
combine this concept with multiple planes

82
00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:37.861
to try to better approximate where
a data point might be located.
