00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
Welcome. This week I will
go over autocorrect.

2
00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.480
It is how your
misspelled words are

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.135
corrected automatically
to the right ones.

4
00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.515
You know it already from your

5
00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.225
email clients on your phone.

6
00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.325
Let me show you how it works.

7
00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.025
Let's go over this week's
learning objectives.

8
00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.860
You will learn about
autocorrect conceptually.

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.450
You've most likely used it in

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.295
your phone or Word processor.

11
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.770
But what is autocorrect exactly?

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.480
It's going to mean
slightly different things

13
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.055
depending on the context.

14
00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:31.530
You will learn about
the nuances this week.

15
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.960
You'll practice building a
model to perform autocorrect.

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.250
You'll learn each step
in autocorrect and

17
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.210
key concepts to prepare you
for the coding assignments.

18
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.580
When performing autocorrect,
you'll learn to be able to

19
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
quantify how far apart or
different to strings are.

20
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.370
Ask how many letters you can

21
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.620
change to go from one
string to another.

22
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.120
To do this, you will learn to

23
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.115
measure minimum edit distance.

24
00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:56.840
You will implement a really

25
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.730
interesting algorithmic
approach for

26
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.620
solving the minimum
edit distance

27
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.870
called dynamic programming.

28
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.520
At the end of the lecture,

29
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.590
you'll demonstrate your
new skills and put

30
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
all these techniques to work
in this week's assignments.

31
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.110
Exciting content.

32
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.390
I'm looking forward to
tell you everything

33
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.120
about how you will be
building your autocorrect.

34
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.490
One very important
concept is that

35
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.810
the autocorrect you will be

36
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.390
building uses
dynamic programming.

37
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.615
This comes up again and again
in technical interviews.

38
00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:28.880
But first, let's
get started with

39
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.610
an overview of autocorrect
in the next video.
