00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.450
We will continue from the previous
video and show you how to do inference.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.740
Given your lambda dictionary
the task is pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.520
You have done most of the work to
arrive at your log likelihood already.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.240
Now let's wrap up.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.546
Now you can calculate the log likelihood
of the tweet as the sum of the lambdas

6
00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:20.240
from each word in the tweet.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.283
So for word I you add 0,
for am you add 0, for

8
00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:28.968
word, happy you had 2.2,
for words because I and

9
00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:34.040
am you add 0 and for
word learning you add 1.1.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.761
This sum is 3.3 and
this value is higher than 0.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.185
Remember how previously you saw
that the tweet was positive if

12
00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:50.050
the product was bigger than 1
with the log of 1 equal to 0.

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.888
The positive values indicate
that the tweet is positive,

14
00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:58.540
a value less than 0 would indicate
that the tweet is negative.

15
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.123
The log likelihood for
the suite is 3.3 and

16
00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:07.340
since 3.3 is bigger than 0,
the tweet is positive.

17
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.480
Notice that this score is based
entirely on the words happy and

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.440
learning both of which
carry a positive sentiment.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.840
All the other words were neutral and
didn't contribute to the score.

20
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.740
See how much influence
the power words have.

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.240
Let's do a quick recap.

22
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.617
You used your new skills to predict
the sentiment of a tweet by summing all

23
00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:32.340
the lambdas for
each word that appeared in the tweet.

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.073
This score is called the log
likelihood for the log likelihood,

25
00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:39.440
the decision threshold
is zero instead of one.

26
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.831
Positive tweets will have a positive
log likelihood above 0, and

27
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:50.895
negative tweets will have a negative
log likelihood below 0, well done.

28
00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:55.607
Congratulations now that you have a good
understanding of how to compute the log

29
00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:57.787
likelihood and how to do inference,

30
00:01:57.787 --> 00:02:01.251
I will proceed to show you how
to train a naive based model.
