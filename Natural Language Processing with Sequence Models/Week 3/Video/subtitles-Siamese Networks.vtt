00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.560
you're going to learn
about a special type of

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.865
neural network known as
the Siamese network.

4
00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.080
It is a neural
network made up of

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.090
two identical neural networks

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.965
which are merged at the end.

7
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.685
This type of architecture has
many applications in NLP.

8
00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.710
In this video, you'll see

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.215
the different examples
where you can use it.

10
00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:24.465
Consider the following question.

11
00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:28.005
How old are you?, and,
what is your age?

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:29.670
You can see that these questions

13
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.560
don't have any words in common.

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.665
However, they both
mean the same thing.

15
00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.450
On the other hand, if you were

16
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.334
to look at the
following questions,

17
00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:40.350
where are you from?, and,

18
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.230
where are you going?, you can

19
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.645
see that the first three
words are the same.

20
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.850
However, the last word

21
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.835
completely changes the
meaning of each question.

22
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.935
This example shows
that comparing

23
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.390
meaning is not as simple
as just comparing words.

24
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.080
Coming up, you're
going to see how

25
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.470
you can use Siamese networks to

26
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.900
compare the meaning
of word sequences

27
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.675
and identify
question duplicates,

28
00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:08.465
which is a very important
NLP application

29
00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:12.365
at the core of platforms like
Stack Overflow or Quora.

30
00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:15.740
Before these platforms allow
you to post a new question,

31
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.750
they want to be sure that
your question hasn't

32
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.080
already been posted
by somebody else.

33
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.750
Now take this sentence,

34
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.830
I'm happy because I'm learning,

35
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.000
and consider it
in the context of

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
sentiment analysis and
binary classification.

37
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.999
Now in training a
classification algorithm,

38
00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.830
you discover what
features give this

39
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.010
statement a positive
or negative sentiment.

40
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.460
With Siamese networks,
you'll be aiming to identify

41
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.540
what's makes two input

42
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.910
similar and what
makes them different.

43
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.205
Take a look at these
two questions.

44
00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.470
What is your age?,
and, how old are you?

45
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.630
When you build a Siamese model,

46
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.135
you're trying to
identify the difference

47
00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.240
or the similarity between
these two questions.

48
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.115
You do this by computing

49
00:01:58.115 --> 00:01:59.975
a single similarity score

50
00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.095
representing the relationship
between the two questions.

51
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.070
Based on that score, when
compared against a threshold,

52
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.570
you can predict whether these

53
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.075
two are the same or different.

54
00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:13.810
Siamese networks have
many applications in NLP.

55
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.180
You can use them to authenticate

56
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.400
handwritten checks
by determining

57
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.905
whether two signatures
are the same or not.

58
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.920
You can use them to identify
question duplicates

59
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.350
on platforms like Quora
or Stack Overflow.

60
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.100
You can use them in search

61
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.240
aging queries to predict whether

62
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.680
a new query is similar to

63
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.140
the one that was
already executed.

64
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.150
These are just a few examples,

65
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.100
but there are many
more applications

66
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.205
of Siamese networks in NLP.

67
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.230
You can use Siamese networks and

68
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.465
many types of NLP applications.

69
00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.985
In the next video,

70
00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:48.860
I will walk you through
the architecture

71
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.530
that is used in
this type of model,

72
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.840
and I'll show you how you
can use it in a text.

73
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.610
I'll see you in the next video.
