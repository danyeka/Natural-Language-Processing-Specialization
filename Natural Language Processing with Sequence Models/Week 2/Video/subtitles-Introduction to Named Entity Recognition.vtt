00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
In this video, I
will tell you about

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.820
named entity recognition,
NER for short.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.590
It's an important problem and

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.655
many NLP systems make
use of NER components.

5
00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.725
Let me tell you what it is.

6
00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:15.960
Named entity recognition is

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.730
a fast and efficient way to scan

8
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
text for certain
kinds of information.

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.300
NER systems locate and extract
named entities from text.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.610
Named entities can
be anything from

11
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.645
a place to an organization
to a person's name.

12
00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:33.180
They can even be
times and dates.

13
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
Let's discuss labels
used by NER systems in

14
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.880
a little more detail as they

15
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.545
relate to your programming
assignment this week.

16
00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:44.060
Some possible classes
you might run across

17
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.870
include geographical
entities like Thailand,

18
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.090
organizations like Google,

19
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.110
or geopolitical
entities like Indian.

20
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.445
A few more classes
you might encounter

21
00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:59.105
include time indicators
like the month of December,

22
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.020
artifacts like this
ancient Egyptian statue,

23
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.660
or a person such
as Barack Obama.

24
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.240
As you can see,
named entities can

25
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.030
capture and identify
all kinds of things.

26
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.280
Say you have the
following sentence;

27
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.385
Sharon flew to
Miami last Friday.

28
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.190
A named entity
recognition system would

29
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.430
extract and classify
Sharon as a personal name,

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.325
Miami as a geographical entity,

31
00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:28.475
and Friday as a time indicator.

32
00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:30.575
You'll notice that here,

33
00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:33.935
B dash denotes an
entity of some kind,

34
00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:35.690
and all the other words are

35
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.035
classified O, for a filler word.

36
00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.420
You can probably already see how

37
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.320
useful this is for
content classification.

38
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.580
In a scenario where
you need to search

39
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.040
large amounts of texts
for certain words,

40
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.050
say Manhattan and Brooklyn,

41
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.180
or Toyota and Subaru,

42
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.135
this becomes handy very quickly.

43
00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:58.565
Here are some
real-world applications

44
00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:00.845
of named entity
recognition systems.

45
00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.990
I mentioned their
ability to scan

46
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.135
documents for certain
things quickly.

47
00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.235
Just imagine how NERs

48
00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:09.904
can optimize search
engine efficiency.

49
00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:13.610
In this case, the NER
model scans millions of

50
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.560
websites once and stores

51
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.725
the entities it's
identified in the process.

52
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:21.170
Then the tags from
your search query are

53
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.870
simply matched against
the website tags.

54
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.575
The same concept extends
to making recommendations,

55
00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:29.540
where the tags might instead be

56
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.090
extracted from your
history and compare it

57
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.100
to similar user histories in

58
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.895
order to recommend things
you might want to check out.

59
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:39.320
This also applies to
matching customers

60
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.810
to an appropriate
customer service agent.

61
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.180
This works similarly
to a phone tree,

62
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.860
where you would be
prompted to provide

63
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.035
some information
about your request.

64
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.790
If you are using an app to

65
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.310
communicate with your
car insurance company,

66
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.110
you might provide some spoken or

67
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.270
typed information, such as,

68
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.730
I need to add another vehicle or

69
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.400
my car was destroyed by
a giant flying squirrel.

70
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.050
You'll then be matched to

71
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.750
the appropriate
agent accordingly.

72
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.310
Another interesting use
case is automatic trading.

73
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.970
For example, you could imagine

74
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.770
building a web scraper to get

75
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.360
news articles of the names of

76
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.660
certain CEOs, stocks,
or cryptocurrencies.

77
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.790
Then feeding those articles

78
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.995
into a sentiments
classification system,

79
00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.235
and making your
trades accordingly.

80
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.825
NER systems have
many applications

81
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.295
in the field of deep learning.

82
00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:31.170
I just gave you one potential
moneymaker for free.

83
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.175
Now you know what named
entity recognition is.

84
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.990
I think it's really
interesting to

85
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.120
see the many places
where it is used.

86
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.560
In the next video,

87
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.900
you will implement
your own NER system.
