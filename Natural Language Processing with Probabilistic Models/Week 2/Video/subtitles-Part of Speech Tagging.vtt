00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome to the second
week of this course.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.140
In this video, you're going to

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.225
learn about parts
of speech tagging.

4
00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:09.660
Specifically, you'll see
the different applications

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.890
that it is used for.

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.020
You'll also learn how to compute

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.630
the accuracy of a
part-of-speech tagger.

8
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.465
First, I'll go over what
parts of speech tagging is.

9
00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.750
Then I'll show you how to use

10
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.940
so-called Markov chains and

11
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.770
hidden Markov models
to create parts

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.125
of speech tags for
your text corpus.

13
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.420
Next, I will introduce

14
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.250
the Viterbi algorithm and

15
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.340
demonstrate how it's used
in hidden Markov models.

16
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.190
You'll get to try this on
your own with an example.

17
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.660
You're going to apply all of

18
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.085
these skills in this
week's coding assignments.

19
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.865
It's a big week, so
let's get started.

20
00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:47.230
Part of speech refers
to the category of

21
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.880
words or the lexical
terms in a language.

22
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.090
Examples of these
lexical terms in

23
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.370
the English language
would be noun,

24
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.519
verb, adjective,
adverb, pronoun,

25
00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.625
preposition although
there are many others.

26
00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.605
Let's take a look
at this sentence.

27
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.385
Why not learn something?

28
00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:06.880
Writing out the names of
these terms can quickly

29
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.415
become cumbersome
during text analysis.

30
00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:12.205
You're going to use a
short representation

31
00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.375
called tags to represent
these categories.

32
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.200
The process of assigning

33
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.750
these tags to the
words of a sentence or

34
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.810
your corpus is referred
to as parts of speech

35
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.360
tagging or POS,
tagging for shorts.

36
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.550
Because POS tags describe

37
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.170
the characteristic structure of

38
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.660
lexical terms in a
sentence or text,

39
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.035
you can use them to make
assumptions about semantics.

40
00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:39.205
They're used for identifying
named entities too.

41
00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.880
In a sentence such as

42
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.910
the Eiffel Tower is
located in Paris,

43
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.530
Eiffel Tower and Paris
are both named entities.

44
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.900
Tags are also used for
coreference resolution.

45
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.850
If you have the two sentences,

46
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.520
the Eiffel Tower is
located in Paris,

47
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.780
it is 324 meters high,

48
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.255
you can use part-of-speech
tagging to infer that

49
00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.570
it refers in this context
to the Eiffel Tower.

50
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.489
Another application is
speech recognition,

51
00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.910
where you use parts of
speech tags to check

52
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.350
if a sequence of words has
a high probability or not.

53
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.550
You now know the
different applications

54
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.025
of parts of speech tagging.

55
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:22.594
In the next video,

56
00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:23.990
you're going to learn about

57
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.030
Markov chains and you'll see how

58
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.830
you can use them to
decode the parts

59
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.660
of speech of a certain sentence.
