00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
Let's do a quick recap.

2
00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:07.675
The transformers library has a pipeline
object that you can use to apply state of

3
00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:10.981
the art transformer models for
different NLP tasks.

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.924
Pipelines take care of pre-processing
your inputs, running the model and

5
00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:17.028
post processing the outsports for you.

6
00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:21.400
So it is human readable for instance with
a pipeline for the question answering

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.250
task, you can use a transformer to answer
different questions provided the context.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.876
To use a transformer model,

9
00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:32.027
you only need to indicate the task that
you need your pipeline to work on.

10
00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:36.675
In other words, pipelines are objects
that you built for specific and

11
00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:39.213
copy tasks to initialize a pipeline.

12
00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:42.750
You only need to pass the task,
but if you need you can also

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.718
indicate the model checkpoints you want
to use to use an initialized pipeline.

14
00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:50.962
You only need to provide
the appropriate inputs that your

15
00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.688
task requires hugging face supports
the most popular NLP tasks.

16
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.942
But hugging face does not focus only
on NLP it also supports other tasks,

17
00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:02.221
such as image classification,
object detection, for

18
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.937
computer vision,
automatic speech recognition and others.

19
00:01:05.937 --> 00:01:10.845
For instance, you could use the familiar
sentiment analysis task if your goal is

20
00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.817
to classify a sequence is positive or
negative.

21
00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:16.411
The input of this pipeline
is a sentence and

22
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.952
the output is the category to
which the sentence belongs.

23
00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:22.873
You can also create a pipeline for
question answering.

24
00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:25.331
If you want a model
that answers questions,

25
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:28.462
extracting information from a context,
you provide.

26
00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:32.338
The input here is the context and
the sets of questions and

27
00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:36.558
the model outputs the corresponding
answers if it finds any.

28
00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:40.740
Another task that you might find
helpful is film mask what you

29
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.171
can use when you need your model
to fill blank spaces in the text.

30
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.951
This pipeline needs the sentence
you want to fill and

31
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.616
the exact position you need
your model to fill it.

32
00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:54.243
It's us puts a series of possible
ways to complete the sentence.

33
00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:58.935
And there are many more tasks that you can
find directly on the hugging face website.

34
00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:00.137
As I already told you,

35
00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:04.584
you can pick the specific model checkpoint
that you want to use with your pipeline.

36
00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:09.007
Hugging face provides a huge number of
checkpoints and some of them are fine

37
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:13.655
tuned using massive data sets to give
exceptional results on specific tasks.

38
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:18.094
However, it's best to keep in mind that
not every checkpoint is suitable for

39
00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:18.854
every task.

40
00:02:18.854 --> 00:02:22.739
So you should check the description
of the pre-trained models to select

41
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.830
the appropriate checkpoint or stick
with the default used by the pipeline.

42
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.499
Finally, you could be asking where can
I find a proper model for my task and

43
00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.156
use the checkpoints, for

44
00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:37.469
that hugging face has a model hub
available as hugging face dot com.

45
00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.191
There you will find several pre-trained
models you'll be able to filter by

46
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:46.409
your desire task or even by the dataset or
framework you need to use.

47
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.729
Once you select the model that
fits better to your needs,

48
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.020
you will see the model card interface.

49
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.962
The model card shows you information about
your selected model such as description

50
00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:59.087
of the same and some code snippets.

51
00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:01.458
Such as a description of the same model,
and

52
00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:05.061
some code snippets with examples
on how to use the selected model.
